		<h1><a href="https://github.com/emilyploszaj/trinkets">Trinkets</a></h1>
		<p>Trinkets is a modular accessory and accessory slot system for the popular game, Minecraft. It is implemented using the Fabric API and is currently the standard API for implementing accessories in the Fabric ecosystem.</p>
		<h1><a href="https://github.com/emilyploszaj/discor.d">discor.d</a></h1>
		<p>discor.d is a feature complete library for interacting with the discord websocket and REST APIs using the D programming language. Compared to the other, less feature complete D Discord libraries, I also want it to be easy to understand and interface with, reliable to use long term, and fun to write with.</p>
		<h1><a href="https://github.com/emilyploszaj/shenzhen-solitaire-gbc">Shenzhen Solitaire GBC</a></h1>
		<p>Shenzhen I/O is one of my favorite games of all time. One of the features that is found in nearly all Zachtronics games is a solitaire, and Shenzhen I/O is no exception. Shenzhen solitaire has a knack for getting ported to interesting platforms (MSDOS, among others), so I ported the game to the Gameboy Color. This has served as good experience working with embedded systems and tight constraints in the C programming language.</p>
		<h1><a href="https://emi.dev">emi.dev</a></h1>
		<p>Of course I wrote my own website! Plain HTML, CSS, and 3 lines of JS (unfortunately the homepage pastel color easter egg prevented me from keeping this at zero).</p>
		<h1>Other Bits</h1>
		<p>I've worked on a large amount of other open source and personal projects, many of which can be found on my <a href="https://github.com/emilyploszaj">Github</a>. These are just some of the ones I'm most proud of.</p>
