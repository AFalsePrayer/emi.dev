		<h1><a href="https://github.com/emilyploszaj/discor.d">discor.d</a></h1>
		<p>This is probably the project I'm the most passionate about. I've been writing it over the past couple years with a very specific interest in mind: to create a very "D" experience for working with the Discord API. Compared to the other, less feature complete D Discord libraries, I also want it to be easy to understand and interface with, reliable to use long term, and fun to write with.</p>
		<h1><a href="https://github.com/emilyploszaj/scrabble-sweeper">Scrabble Sweeper</a></h1>
		<p>One of my longest running projects that has seen many rewrites and goal changes. The current version is being designed to flexible to change and expand on while also providing the same experience it always has. I've had the domain <a href="http://scrabblesweeper.net">scrabblesweeper.net</a> parked for over a year and that's where the final product will be hosted.</p>
		<h1><a href="https://github.com/emilyploszaj/midi-mapper">MIDI Mapper</a></h1>
		<p>One of the sillier things I've worked on. It started with me wanting to play a video game with my electronic piano. I also wanted it to sound vaguely musical, staying in the same key and playing nice sounding notes and chords. I found no solution for it really existed, so I had a fun time building a simple tool to get the job done. It also gave me a chance to work with a built in web server client display, which I enjoyed.</p>
		<h1>Other Bits</h1>
		<p>I've worked on a huge amount of smaller things. Of note, I've worked on a contribution to the popular open source speedrun timer, <a href="https://livesplit.org/">LiveSplit</a>.</p>
