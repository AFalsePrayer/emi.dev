		<p>Quantum Chess is a simple game. It's just like chess! Except for the vaguely inspired quantum mechanics. Instead of capturing just one piece, you can capture as many as are available and split your piece into uncertainty. Being captured will collapse the wave function and they will all vanish, but if you can keep them safe they'll benefit you. More rules explained on the page.</p>

		<p>Know how to write Java targets really well? Brushing up on your mixin skills? Forced by a demon to learn every Yarn mapping by heart? This "game" is for you!</p>
		<div class="inline-link"><a href="../tritris">Tritris</a><span class="inline-path">../tritris</span></div>
		<p>Tritris is a very much half finished attempt to make a block stacking game with equilateral triangles, rather than half squares like contemporaries. Pieces are all 6 rotationally unique patterns made of 5 connected triangles: the cyan "I", the magenta "C", the orange "L", the blue "J", the green "S" and the red "Z". Gameplay is typical of block stacking games.</p>
